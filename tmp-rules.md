## §2 - Game only rules

Rules marked with an asterisk (*) do not apply on Arcade servers and inside of No Collision Zones. Traffic laws and road signage must be obeyed. This means European road laws and signage must be followed in ETS2 and American road laws and signage must be followed in ATS. Failure to adhere to the respective road laws and signage could result in a punishment. Traffic lights and stop signs can be ignored if no other users are in the immediate area. Speeding, while allowed, is not recommended. Speeding can lead to accidents and can factor in a punishment decision. Baiting other players into accidents will not be tolerated and is punishable. Areas with 25+ players are considered highly populated.  

**§2.1 - Hacking/Bug/Feature abusing - PERMANENT BAN**

Using any kind of tool to change gameplay, including but not limited to using the in-game console, trainers or cheat engine in order to bypass the speed limiter, to jump hack, no collision hack or anything similar. Bypassing the server-sided auto kick system via save editing. Misusing features such as ghost mode to cause damage to others while connecting to the servers.

**§2.2 - Collisions***

Causing or attempting to cause a collision with another player intentionally or due to negligence.

**§2.3 - Blocking***

Restricting a user's travel path, blocking entrances to highways or other entry points or anything similar. Failure to use the service feature (F7+Enter) when needed might result in a punishment.

**§2.4 - Incorrect Way / Inappropriate Overtaking***

Driving the incorrect way down a road. Overtaking or undertaking another player in an area of extremely low FPS and/or in highly populated areas and/or resulting in an accident or the endangerment of other players. This also includes overtaking or undertaking on any one-lane in each direction road where there is excessive traffic such as a traffic jam.  

**§2.5 - Reckless Driving***

Driving in such a way that is considered unsafe and that puts other players in danger. This includes but is not limited to: driving backwards, ignoring traffic lights or road signage, speeding, racing other users (except in Tucson, Phoenix, and Södertälje (ProMods) racetracks). Driving outside of the map boundaries or in areas that are not covered by the mini map/GPS. Hidden roads which are intentionally part of the map are not included. You can use these roads. In ProMods, you can drive on unlocked roads or paths. Attempting to use desync lag or quick saves in order to cause damage to another user's vehicle. Using the ghost mode feature to go through traffic jams. 

**§2.6 - Inappropriate Convoy Management / Car Abuse***

Convoys are expected to follow all TruckersMP rules without altering the normal traffic flow. Convoy pilots are not permitted to slow down, block, control traffic and act as a staff member or otherwise abuse the pilot scheme paint job. It's not permitted to organise a convoy in the following areas when highly populated: Kirkenes quarry (ProMods map), the Duisburg to Calais road, and in the cities of Calais and Duisburg. More than 5 players driving together is classed as a convoy.  

**§2.7 - Event Servers**

All rules apply to any event server unless approved temporary rules override for a certain event.

Event server requirements can be found [here](https://truckersmp.com/knowledge-base/article/671).

Temporary rules for events can be found [here](https://forum.truckersmp.com/index.php?/topic/14237-temporary-rules-valid-during-an-event-or-a-convoy/).

**§2.8 - How bans are issued**

- The first 3 bans are issued at the staff member’s discretion.
- The 4th ban is thirty days.
- The 5th ban and consecutive bans are ninety days.

Any bans older than 12 months at the time of the new ban being issued are ignored, this 12 month period is the ban cooling-off period. Ban extensions are based on the active (less than 12 months old) bans at the time of expiration and will not be altered if a ban goes over the 12 month period while the ban is active. If you have at least two active history bans in your ban history, staff will extend your next ban to a ninety days ban, regardless of how many bans you have had in the last year. Bans that are extended due to history cannot be removed, they are strictly thirty days and ninety days.

**§2.9 - Bans issued by the Game Moderation Management**

If the Game Moderation Management thinks that a user joins TruckersMP with the sole purpose to violate the rules, "§2.8 - How bans are issued" can be bypassed and the ban length will be at the Game Moderation Management's discretion. In accordance with our [Terms of Service](https://truckersmp.com/terms) staff are allowed to re-use evidence sent in our reports. In specific cases, the Game Moderation Management reserves the right to keep ban evidence private upon review of the banned player.

---
## §3 - Save Editing

Causing extreme lag or game crashes by save editing is not permitted. Extreme lag will not occur from duplicate parts unless the amount is truly excessive. If you save edit to create a very long trailer combination but cannot safely handle it, you are liable to be banned for reckless driving and/or blocking and it is recommended that you remove the particular modification(s). If the Game Moderation Management thinks that your modification is not fit for our servers or negatively impacts other people, you are liable to be banned until the modification has been removed.
