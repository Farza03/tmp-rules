## §2 - Game only rules

Rules marked with an asterisk (*) do not apply on Arcade servers and inside of No Collision Zones unless otherwise specified. Traffic laws, road signage and smart signs (§2.7) must be obeyed based on the countries/states respective legislation. Traffic lights and stop signs can be ignored if no other users are in the immediate area. Speeding, while allowed, is not recommended.

Areas with 25+ players are considered highly populated.

Driving the incorrect way down a road. Overtaking or undertaking another player in highly populated areas and/or resulting in an accident or the endangerment of other players. This also includes overtaking or undertaking on any one-lane in each direction road where there is excessive traffic such as a traffic jam.  

**§2.5 - Reckless Driving***

This includes but is not limited to: driving backwards, ignoring traffic lights or road signage, speeding, speeding up to prevent overtakes, racing other users (exception made for in-game racetracks, dragstrips or testing grounds).

Using the ghost mode feature to go through traffic jams. 

**§2.6 - Inappropriate Convoy Management / Car Abuse***

Convoys are expected to follow all TruckersMP rules without altering the normal traffic flow. Convoy pilots are not permitted to slow down, block, control traffic and act as a team member or otherwise abuse the pilot scheme paint job. It's not permitted to organise a convoy in the following areas when highly populated: Kirkenes quarry (ProMods map), the Duisburg to Calais road, and in the cities of Calais and Duisburg. More than 5 players driving together is classed as a convoy.  

**§2.7 - Featured Zone & Event Servers**

A Featured Zone is an area with heightened team presence altering local road conditions. Players must obey all instructions given by TruckersMP staff during these live operations and must respect all Smart Signs by following the [respective rules](https://truckersmp.com/knowledge-base/article/1091) for them.

- Players must not interfere with the operations planned by the TruckersMP team.
- Players must not create their own "operations" or otherwise risk violating rule §2.6: "Inappropriate Convoy Management / Car Abuse".
- Players must yield to all emergency/service vehicles where safe. The TruckersMP team may perform rolling road blocks, and pull over or request players to move out of the way for responding emergency vehicles during the management of operations.

Event servers are limited access temporary servers for special events. All rules apply to any event server unless approved temporary rules override for a certain event.

- Event server requirements can be found [here](https://truckersmp.com/knowledge-base/article/671).
- Temporary rules for events can be found on their respective event page [here](https://truckersmp.com/event-request).

**§2.8 - How bans are issued**

- The first 3 bans are issued at the staff member’s discretion.
- The 4th ban is thirty days.
- The 5th ban and consecutive bans are ninety days.

Any bans older than 12 months at the time of the new ban being issued are ignored, this 12 month period is the ban cooling-off period. Ban extensions are based on the active (less than 12 months old) bans at the time of expiration and will not be altered if a ban goes over the 12 month period while the ban is active. If you have at least two active history bans in your ban history, staff will extend your next ban to a ninety days ban, regardless of how many bans you have had in the last year. Bans that are extended due to history cannot be removed, they are strictly thirty days and ninety days.

**§2.9 - Bans issued by the Game Moderation Management**

If the Game Moderation Management thinks that a user joins TruckersMP with the sole purpose to violate the rules, "§2.8 - How bans are issued" can be bypassed and the ban length will be at the Game Moderation Management's discretion. In accordance with our [Terms of Service](https://truckersmp.com/terms) staff are allowed to re-use evidence sent in our reports. In specific cases, the Game Moderation Management reserves the right to keep ban evidence private upon review of the banned player.
